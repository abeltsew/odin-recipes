    <p>
      This is the classic lasagne alla Bolognese recipe from the Emilia region
      in Northern Italy. The Bolognese sauce is made with a mixture of beef and
      pork mince. The addition of prosciutto, red wine, cinnamon, and nutmeg
      make it truly authentic.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
      <li>1 carrot, chopped</li>
      <li>1 shallot, minced</li>

      <li>3 ½ ounces prosciutto, chopped</li>

      <li>1 ounces ground pork</li>

      <li>11 ounces ground beef</li>

      <li>1 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>

      <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir onion,
        carrot, shallot, and prosciutto until onion is translucent and
        prosciutto releases some fat, about 10 minutes. Add pork and beef;
        season with 1 teaspoon nutmeg, cinnamon, and salt to taste. Cook and
        stir over medium-high heat until browned and crumbly, about 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour red wine over meat mixture; increase heat and cook until wine
        evaporates, about 3 minutes. Add tomatoes and mix well; bring to a boil,
        cover, reduce heat, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes
        break down and flavors of Bolognese sauce have combined, 1 1/2 to 2
        hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        Melt butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat; add flour. Whisk
        vigorously until mixture is smooth. Pour in milk and cook, stirring
        occasionally, over medium heat until white sauce thickens enough to
        cover the back of a spoon, about 10 minutes; season with 1/2 teaspoon
        nutmeg, salt, and pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna
        noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet
        firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain and run under cold water to
        stop the cooking process. Lay noodles on a clean towel and pat dry.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Pour a ladleful of Bolognese sauce and a ladleful of white sauce over
        the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish; top with 3 or 4 lasagna noodles.
        Cover noodles with 1/3 of the white sauce and 1/3 of the Bolognese
        sauce. Sprinkle some of the Parmesan cheese on top; cover with lasagna
        noodles. Repeat layers, ending with white sauce and Parmesan cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until bubbling and top is golden brown, 30 to
        40 minutes. Let stand 3 to 4 minutes before slicing.
